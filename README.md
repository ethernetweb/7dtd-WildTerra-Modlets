These are some of the mods that I use. Will add more over time I'm sure.

You are free to use them however you wish (see LICENSE).


Special thanks to other modders for their contributions.

(Some of these modlets are based off their initial modlets.)

(Some modlets are not listed here but credit is given to the authors anyway because I was able to learn from their work.)


giKoN, Pringlz46290, stasis78 - Assisted with making the Copper Zinc modlet functional.

Snappy - Provided the base for solar cell and solar panel crafting.

Guppycur - Provided the base for the "random get up time" of zombies.

JaxTeller718 - Quite simply; just a great list of modlets along the same line of thought as Wild Terra.

Deceptive Pastry - provided the basis for the ActionExp / auto-level skills.

stedman420 - I learned something from his mods but honestly can't remember right now. Lol.
